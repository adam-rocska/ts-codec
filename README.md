# Codec – Encode & Decode for TypeScript

Provides a convenient & strongly-typed API to perform coding and decoding operations between datatypes in TypeScript.

Conceptually inspired by Swift's Codable API, however it's nowhere near it. The first version's goal is to provide a basic yet convenient functional API for these tasks.

See this repo's GitHub Pages for an API doc'.

## Disclaimer

Since this repo is an initial step in open-sourcing our more robust internal `ts-codec` solution:

* More features are to be expected
* Though we do our best to avoid them, some hiccups may occur.

The end goal is to switch our dependency direction from internal first
to external first. Internall we do use the migrated code but in a different environment, so differences could happen.
