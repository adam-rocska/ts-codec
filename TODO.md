## Make things nicer
- [ ] Exceptions' generic structure is shit.
- [ ] Would be great to wrestle `KeyOfType` in typefest.
– [ ] Bring back our oneliner style once we figure out how to know out prettier's dumb restrictions.
- [ ] For now we only have a few measily "meh" quality unit tests. We'll need component, system and regression tests by summer.
